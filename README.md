Android MVP Template with toothpick
-----

This template is inspired by [How to create a group of File Templates in Android Studio](https://riggaroo.co.za/custom-file-template-group-android-studiointellij/)

Main differences is that the templates generate kotlin files and also Toothpick for Dependency Injection.

Mostly this is intended for personal use since it is really boring to do this by hand.
